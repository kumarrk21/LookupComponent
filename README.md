Lookup Lightning Component
===============================

The LookupComponent lightning component can be used in other components and lightning apps to easily invoke Salesforce1 style lookup UI. As of now, this component can be used only in other components or apps through code and cannot be used in App builder. This is because, this component takes a couple of attributes in JSON format and at this point(as of Summer '16), dynamic attribute value mapping is not available in Lightning app buidler yet. This component currently supports both multi-select and single select capabilities and uses lightning design system for styling. Install the component in your org and navigate to /auradocs/reference.app for detailed documentation on how to use it.
